# Killergame - Last man standing ü©∏
This is the 5-year anniversary edition of Killergame at Procivitas. Killergame, which is a popular high school competition, is about "killing" as many as possible while you try to survive yourself. The players have certain "weapons" of choice, a leek for example, which they need to touch the target with. Once the target gets attacked and is touched by a "weapon", they are out of the game. The competition is usually only held once a year in connection with Halloween.

## The web app
All players register and play with the web app. They are assigned a 6-digit code which acts as a secret given by the target to the killer.

### Features
#### School-speicific sign-up
To avoid registering players that don't attend the school, the player needs to provide grade and the first characters in their school-email-address.
